	General Notes

- I am going to use Three.js instead of Pixi js since it may be easier.
- Nevermind goin back to Pixi since this is manly a 2D game.
- Trying to figure out how I want to add the cross sections of the 3D animated objects in the game
I may just be able to take the cross sections in a program like Maya and export it to a 2D image
I would then just need to animate the models in Maya then go from there. The downsides is that I can 
not add models dynamically I would have to go through a really annoying process
- If I can figure out a way to dynamically add animated 3D models to the scene that would be great.
